                    using wastewater, and providing a place for a latrine.</p>

                <p>If you have ever enjoyed an afternoon in a Japanese public garden, you know that the experience feels transcendent. Koi
                ponds give way to carefully pruned cherry blossom trees or an outdoor bonsai garden. A simple walkway, shadowed by
                bamboo, encourages reflective silence. Every minute feels like a reset for the body and mind.</p>

                <h4> How to Have a Beautiful Garden in Full Sun </h4>
                <img width="565" height="340" src="images/image5.jpg" alt="Beautiful Garden">
                <p>Spots that soak up sunshine from sunrise to sunset are prime candidates for gardens overflowing with color,
                    flowers and
                    tasty produce. But not all plants can stand up to direct, full sun. By understanding your garden's light
                    levels and
                    meeting the needs of sun-loving plants, you can enjoy a beautiful full-sun garden worthy of a gardener's
                    dreams. Monastic gardens were often maintained outside of monasteries' walls and watered with complex
                    irrigation systems. These
                    gardens contained fruit trees, broadleaf vegetables, and vineyards to feed the monks and pilgrims.</p>

                <p>The lower garden running along the river, was the original vegetable garden. This was moved further away to
                    create a
                    romantic French-style garden designed by Edouard André a renowned landscaper in the 19th century.
